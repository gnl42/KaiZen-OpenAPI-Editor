# KaiZen OpenAPI Editor for Eclipse

KaiZen OpenAPI Editor is an Eclipse Editor for the [Swagger](http://swagger.io) API Description Language, now known as the [OpenAPI Specification](http://openapis.org). The editor supports Swagger-OpenAPI version 2.0, with OpenAPI 3.0 support coming soon. 

KaiZen Editor was developed for [RepreZen API Studio](http://reprezen.com/swagger-tools), a comprehensive solution for API modeling, documentation, visualization, testing and code generation, built on Eclipse.

We welcome your suggestions and contributions!
